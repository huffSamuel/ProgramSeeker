# ProgramSeeker V0.2!

ProgramSeeker is a GUI utility for the command-line WMIC utility. It's initial purpose was to scan all nodes on a network to retrieve currently installed software. The software is currently functional and can be used, but is somewhat clunky. My time is currently dedicated to finishing up computer labs for the term and this is taking more of a back-burner position (at least for the time being).
